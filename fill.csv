1,Flagship Killer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Performance-5/5Battery Backup-5/5Fast charging-5/5Display-5/5Camera-5/5Design-5/5Will edit my review after a week of usage.
2,Worthy real flagship killer replacing oneplus,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using Neo 6 for last two days and I am in love with it.I am a regular user with primary usage for entertainment and browsing.. haven't experienced any lags and display performance is awesome..Perfectly fits in hand and doesn't feel overweight..Have tested taking a few samples on rear camera and surprisingly they come out to be good at this price point.. probably effect of being vivo's sub brand.. software optimisation is good..Overall I would give 9/10 for this device and easily recommend for anyone looking at this price point.
3,Just one word awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5.0 out of 5 stars,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†In this price range.... it's best.... you can trust me, please ignore negative comments!.Performance,camera, sensors, display battery all are really good.No lag,buttery smooth experience  thanks to great optimization and 120Hz refresh rate.Snapdragon 870 is handling all tasks very smoothly.One suggestion.Drain your battery üîã to zero,take one cup tea and some snacks,start watching daily soap/webseries for 35 minutes after putting the phone in charge.You will really surprise how could it be possible?!Phone is fully charged!!!(Thanks to 80 watt Vivo charger)NFC missing üòîSD card slot missing üòî3.5 mm jack missing üòîBut after seeing the performance I can easily ignore these cons!!!"
4,"Honest opinion on this phone is that, Iqoo is innovating much better than OnePlus nowadays.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an Ios user, I am genuinely speaking that aboth camera performance and gaming experience are better than 50k budgets phones of Samsung s21fe or OnePlus 9rt..Two of my friends have both of these above smartphones, but they got surprised by the pictures which got captured by Iqoo Neo 6. Practically they admired the quality of the pictures captured by my device.Never thought that Iqoo can outperformed those device but it really happened..Honestly speaking Iqoo is innovating much better than OnePlus or Samsung like smartphones but don't know how many day's it will be continued.On my point of view I will surely suggest anyone to buy this smartphone as it has no major heating issues,no bugs problem,Funtouch OS is really much better than I expected, battery health is also nice, Camera performane and gaming experience is just outstanding.In one word it's a killer smartphone under budget 30k which can also beat 50k smartphones.Apart from these Iqoo Neo 6, I am also using iphone 13 and I will definitely upload a camera comparison video between these two smartphones."

Commanding Sd 870, already proven, made even better with Graphic chip. Great job iqoo...2. Battery you gave awesome, but more awesome you gave charger. 80w omg delighted. Help me so much already3. Camera: other camera are okay and dont care. Main camera.u give OIS nd sweet deal. You give 64 MP, omg you already become best.4. Display = marvellous. 120hz feels like a dream. Many dont know E4.

But 870 doesn't heat so that is- monster touch feels like not useful but we xperiance and it becomes habit... So good i want it all the time (high battery but okay)- touch sample is fast. Felt the difference was slow in mi realme and oneplus.So good that i forgot to eat.- os software ui. I have not use much till now nut editing videos from yesterday and it was smooth....

My friend has iqoo 7 and he love it for so many years and now i love iqoo also."
7,Value for money product,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall very good phone in this price point. I checked oneplus nord ce 2 as well but I think I got lot more with this specially my dream 8 series processor. I was skeptical about the UI but it is good. No ads is plus point compared xiaomis of the world.
8,Best budget phone in this range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've researched so many phones in a while and finally ordered MI11X , the phone was going to be delivered on 1 June and on 31st i saw this phone launching and researched about the specs of this phone the specs were higher of iqoo neo 6 in comparison of MI11X and then I cancelled my order to order this phone and I think that it's worth it because mi11x being 1 year old and having Android 11 gives some sort of ancient vibe and the camera of this phone is perfect in the range.Ignore the photo of my cat , he wasn't stillThe size of the phone is much pretty similar to iqoo z3 and it's somewhat lighter than iqooz3 idk if it's really is but it feels a little lighter in comparison of the weight of iqoo z3"
9,Let's bust some myth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this phone based on specs it was providing, later I saw flood of negative reviews coming up on Amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned, if it was true.1. Calls getting disconnected - I had call with my brother last night and we talked for 50 min and call did not disconnect in the middle.2. Heating issue - While in day to day use never faced heating issue but It gets a little hot while charging, I can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable. Every phone with fast charging heats a little.3. Camera Quality - It has a decent 64 mp Samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes. You can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good. Attached pic of cake which I clicked indoor only bright light source was candle. It performed well I can say.(To people who complaint about camera -  I just cannot expect picture clarity of Apple or Samsung high end devices, i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid)4. AnTuTu Benchmark Score - While company claim of 740000+ while I tested i got a score of 700000+ . I again cannot complaint here because I don't know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing. 700000+ is pretty decent score I can say5. Phone lag - In two days of testing it has not lagged at all. With multiple background apps running.6. Battery Drain - Revisit few of the settings on your device, like animation, transition effect etc to get most out of your battery. If your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most. Again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company. While I started to write this review my cell phone was at 100%. Now it's almost 25 min typing till now it's now showing 99%, i have set my screen at full brightness, i fell its decent. Also tested charging speed 0 to 50 in 12.03 min.7. Build quality - It's sturdy and decent plastic is used. I can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint (Card Discount + Exchange Benefit etc) . Still I would take out 1 star here.8. Black colour issue - Did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour. It's AMOLED screen. Black is highlight of AMOLED. In case you were using IPS / FHD panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing. I have Samsung M51 as secondary device and i see black similar on both.9. BGMI - I played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag.10. Two year warranty - They calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only 1 year. I have personally wrote to Iqoo team and Amazon team seeking an answer, with screenshots waiting for answer.BTW majority of phone manufacturers provide 1 year warranty only, even iPhone. Here I would say fight for you justice and seek answer from Iqoo or Amazon Team.11. Video call lag - Did not face any, did multiple video calls yesterday with different people, did not get any complaint from them about my video lag. For all of them my video popped up instantaneous.Overall I would say I had a great buy and can recommend this device to others , for all the folks bombarding negative reviews, I would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied. In case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justice.Overall i give this device a 4 star as of now since I am yet to test this device long term like 3 months or 4 months.*Please excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any. Entire review was typed on my phone Iqoo Neo 6."
10,Absolute beast with no heating issues,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have seen 888 heats a lot in youtube but with neo 6 with 870 and I am just amazed with the type of cooling this smatphone has is awesome üëç.120 hz display is so smooth that you just can't go back to 60 hz. And every app opens so fast and ram management is better than OnePlus and I mean it. This funtouch os doesn't has one touch lockscreen which I earlier used in realme, other than it I am ok with it."

12,All Rounder Phone under 30k range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I see small detail very clearl in Phone (Gaming, Movies, Camera)Got for 20k with exchange and offersNo Lag or frame drops in BGMI Game‚Ä¶..In heavy performance taks less battery backup‚Ä¶..Performance is reliable and loving clearr of call quality"
13,Worst camera under flagship segment,1.0 out of 5 stars,"IQOO Neo 6 has worst camera which is like a normal midrange phone but not as flagship mobile, usually this kind of cameras comes for 15-18k price mobiles. Quick charging is good but battery drains very fast, so battery segment also failed. And no security, as per terms n conditions clearly says that our data will be shared out of region as well (data will be shared to Chinese server).This mobile is useful only for gamersAs per my view mobile price should be b't 15k-18k."
14,Call disconnects every 5 mins.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You cannot continue a call for more than 5 minutes. Phone has call drop issue. So, I requested Amazon for replacement, but they keep on sending technicians and are not replacing the phone. It's a shame that even after spending 30,000 you cannote even properly make calls."
15,Gaming Powerhouse !!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never felt this kind of Gaming dominance with any other Phone.No sign of heating or lagging with BGMI (3 hrs I play yesterday)Itna clear display that I could see the enemies clearly who were hide in grassI have used OnePlus Nord and Mi A3 before but this Neo 6 is something out of this world.Design - Looks like a 70-80k Phone (Like iPhone 13 Green Colour)Camera - When Vlogging I feel hardly any shaky feeling in VideoCharging - Phone was charged in hardly 20 min time. As much time as it took me to get ready in morning.Felt unbelievable!!Highly Recommended Phone from my side!!

19,Antutu scroe is Not 740000+ and No Extended Warranty recived.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Total disappointment, the Antutu Score is not 740000+ as shown in the promotional image on the product page. Also, I bought it during the 2-year extended warranty offer but received only 1 year, where is the extended warranty?"
20,Didn't meet expectations,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although it is gaming oriented phone, i expected it to have good camera quality and sound at least.My initial comparison for this device is with my pixel 4a.Compared photo qualiy- photo came out better on pixel 4a (fine since it's pixel anyways)Compared sound - this is where I am disappointed, being a gaming device sound should have better than pixel at least, but Pixel is better here as well.Also, it was 40% charged when came and got discharged to 11% within the time I set it up in next 30 min. Bit concerned for battery life as well.At this point, I am disappointed with the phone."

25,Not gud,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quality is not good . Display quality is bad. Fell like Mi phones. Wrong commitment of fast charging. Camera is not gud . All over not worth of money
26,iqoo 7 is still better deal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Same Camera sensor is used of Redmi note 9 pro max.So picture details of main camera is just below average. Dynamic range is good. Front camera is Decent. But iqoo 7 is far better than this. Charging time is appox same even iqoo7 has better battery backup with 4400 mAh battery. So wait for offer on iqoo7.

30,Super smooth and superb gaming experience!,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's actually a gift from a very dear friend who has been using a different product from the same brand. I just finished 2.5-3 hours of straight gaming and wow is the word for the overall gaming experience. Simply wow! I believe it was because of Qualcomm870 and 1200 Hz Touch Sampling. Good technology always makes me happy and am quite happy to be one of the first few owners of this powerful product:)

34,Connectivity Issues (Call drops and WiFi issues),1.0 out of 5 stars,"Beware guys. There is serious connectivity issue with this phone. Don't go over the looks as I did. The first phone I received was having call drops issue. The call was getting dropped every few minutes. Sometimes within two minutes sometimes in 5 minutes, randomly. I got it replaced and the second phone I received worked perfectly for one week when the return window was still open and then it started disconnecting from wifi and now it simply won't connect with my WiFi. Plus the call dropping issue started showing up in this new handset as well.And remember one thing while shopping online. Amazon customer support is only helpful in the ideal conditions. They will only help if they don't have to put any extra efforts other than what they are trained and wired up for. If things go south only by one degree they will simply leave you hanging out there and will simply repeat the same phrase with a puppy face ""Sorry but there's nothing we can do about it"". Doesn't matter if you are a prime or superprime member.Am more frustrated by the customer services than the phone manufacturer.It was hard earned money which I just lost to this damn junk box."
35,Beast mobile!!! Really flagship killer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Camera is just mind blowing.... Very much clear as compared to OnePlus 9R...Was too confused to go with Iqoo brand but decided to go with it considering 2 years warranty for 17000 after exchang very old mobile.. And am sure will never regret it. The best part of the mobile is camera and speed. Just go for it!!
36,Pathetic! Pathetic! Pathetic!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Iqoo neo 6 has too much screen bleeding issue. I replaced the 1st one and the new one has more screen bleeding problem than the previous one. Screen bleeding problem is only visible when you're in a dark room and your phone has black wallpaper or black screen on it.Another problem is that you can't use two Whatsapp account simultaneously while watching youtube or any other video. If you try to do so your phone will restart autometically. And it happened not just once but everytime. Otherthan that display, battery, camera are good and sound and fingerprint sensor are on the okayish side.I tweeted Iqoo india about all these problems and got no reply from them. Then I contacted Iqoo through mail and the reply was go to service centre thats all.One more thing is that you won't see much bad reviews about the product on Amazon. This is the 2nd time I'm trying to write the review. My 1st review was declined by Amazon. Don't know whether amazon and Iqoo have partnership on selling Iqoo neo 6."

Color and skin tone saturation are amazing for good day light photos3. UI - Funtouch OS 12  UI is simple and awesome. After uninstalling the default unnecessary apps and controlling notification.Cons:1. Front Camera can be improved  In low light condition,  sometimes Skin tones are over saturated2. User Agreement & Permission  It asks user agreement accept for all system apps and settings. It can be onetime and in one place  during first startup"

48,Best phone i recommend. Call issue resolved after switching off wifi calling.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good mobile, got in offer at 22k after exchanging old phone (honor play), card discount and no cost emi.First time received my order after a week in Amazon. Usually I get my orders in a day from Amazon (location Bangalore)Blindly go for it if you get good offers.1) Snapdragon 870 too fast - office mail and teams works very fast than my pc. All apps opens very fast.2) Battery too fast charging - 60% in just 15 to 20 mins.3) Display - Same like my other mobile (one plus 7t) amoled screen. 120hz refresh is added advantage.4) OS - From oxygen to fun tounch I don't see much difference. In all aspects this will beat one plus.5) Camera  - Above average6) Dual speakers too load and call connectivity is also very good. You get a headphones jack adaptor as well in the box.7) Regular software updates is good from Iqoo with additional warranty. So no need to change mobile for next 3 years minimum.Overall you can order blindly without having any doubt.Edited after 15 days- Had call connection issue which is now resolved after switching off wifi calling."
49,Ok...ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Indoor Camera performance is very very poor. Lot of software bugs, need optimization. I'm also experiencing network issues like low speed 4g after recieving a call, call get disconnected itself, sometimes no sound from other side. Hopefully they can fix it. Phone don't connect itself to strongest wifi network.Good things are outdoor photography and selfie, sound and multimedia, battery, screen, and ofcourse the gaming performance"
50,Good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only used the phone for a day. Can't comment on long term issues.Pros:1. Phone doesn't get heated up when charging.2. Solid all rounder phone.3. AMOLED Screen is responsive with good colour reproduction.4. Battery management is good.5. Charging speed is superb.Cons:1. Too much bloatware pre-installed. BLOATWARE BLOATWARE everywhere.2. Sound is strictly okay.3. No instructions on how to claim the 2 year extended warranty.4. Camera setup is average at best. Front camera is  specially disappointing.5. Camera UI is not super intuitive.Overall, a solid phone for daily use. Can't comment on the gaming usage as I don't play them."
51,Camera is too much good,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am writing this review after uses of 10 day and I am surprised with  this IQOO NEO 6,it's camera quality is too much good and night mode also gud , it's video at 4k is very very nice quality and seems like as  it made with DSLR and it's quality of video doesn't show much effect while uploading on social media.But its wide angle is not good as expect and depth camera is not very good it's fine (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)And üîã battery life is medium (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)It's 80 watt fast charging is super coolIt's processor is also excellent with 120 hz refresh rate . It does not hang on playing BGMI even at 4 -5 hr of continous playing but little heats after 1 hr of playing At last iam very happy with thisAnd I recommend to buy and go through with this in this budjetIt's much better than one plus Nord 2 in camera and performance"
52,Best all-rounder value for money phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,According to the price Iqoo Neo 6 is best in the market. Got it for 27k.Using it for one week and till now not experienced any kind of problems except only few widgets are available.+ First of all phone looks premium. It's lightweight and very comfortable in hand with back cover also. Dark nova colour is a beauty.+BGMI 60 FPS constant without any frame drop played for 4+ hous continuosly. Never experienced any kind of over heating. 90 FPS not available yet.+ Camera is really good. Night mode is works great. Lots of camera features available + Amazing Battery Backup and very quick charging; 30 minutes is enough for the day.+ Great display and high contrast mode available for gaming.+ No 3.5mm jack but iqoo is providing type C to 3.5mm adaptor in the box and working perfectly fine.Recommended to hard-core gamers. Go for it
53,Beast in budget,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't go after YouTube marketing scams.Genuine full simple review. No bakwaas in depth details. You will read what you want to listen.in details sabke palle nahi padega.jo important hai wohi reveiw karenge , So let's come to the point.PS: Review made solely considering Price inc. of all discounts and offers.My Variant is 12Gb/256gb Nova blue*Camera*- Above average 8.5/10*Screeen Scrolling speed Hz* - super fast no lags 10/10*Gaming*- SD870  beast in this segment. 10/10*Touch response* - great 9.5/10*Display*- top notch crystal clear 10/10. *Streaming Quality*-Supports almost any of the top Quality available for high quality I have tested 2160p 295-Sidhu's played without any hiccups. 10/10*Battery Backup*- Standby mode - in 18hr just droped 13%.In moderate use - 8+hrs( YouTube, reels )Gaming use- played non stop 4hrs bgmi with 79%battery after 4hrs batter dropped at 57% so yes good very. (with Monster mode and ultra mode ON) 10/10Battery charge- Superb ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç when on 50% I charged for 15minutes to 100% great +100/1090fps- yet to come on next update.Gaming smoothness is super but with pre-installed guard I felt like my joystick movement was slow could be because i shifted from OnePlus 7T which had 90fps by default and iPad mini 5 which has bigger display and joystick button.Else gaming was par with this device.*Value for money*??- Depends on budget of each. I exchanged my 2.5yrs old ONEP PLUS 7T and got it in 18600‚Çπ so yes value for money for me 10/10.What I suggest?  If you want it to use for Max 2yrs buy it else go with premium phones which may cost you a much more but will worth your experience but like I say everything with ultra models and iPhone series you will get best but when you come on battery backup they all suck big time.Agge aap logon ki marzi.

54,Excellent blindly go for it with out any hesitations,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey there I am reviewing this on IQOO NEO 6üòâ. I got this phone for 21k including exchange and bank offers. Damn this phone is a beast. It's smooth like butter. I am not really a big fan of funtouch OS,but it has improved. There are some bugs in contact saving and all but it will be rectified through updates. If you can get these phone for 26k,take it without any hesitations. It's the best value for money at this price range (26k). Camera is good, performance is top notch and battery optimisation is okk, incredible fast charging support. If u r looking for a best phone at 26k IQOO NEO6 stands out really good."

Vibration motor is top notch10. IR blaster is also presentCons:1. Missing headphone jack2. Front camera has a ring around it.3. Plastic back means it is prone to scratches and marks4. Animation like raise to wake , double tap to sleep / wake couldve been optimized for smother experience5. Due to fast charging the battery drains . Bear in mind with above avg gaming it is a one day phone and with mild gaming can stretch it to 1.5day.I purchased it for 21k using icici offer and exchange.OVERALL : 4.8/5"
56,IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THIS READ THE FULL REVIEW PLEASE üôè,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm writing this genuinely after using this device after 3 days.First of all at this price range, it is the value for money ü§ë i bought this one for 27k.CAMERA : camera is better than average at this price range, in good lightning it'll give you very pleasant photos. It'll be crisps but it won't be the best if you compare with other devices at 30k price but the camera isn't disappointing at all and even with selfies i don't have any problem.BATTERY : the best part of this phone is battery üîã to be honest without playing any games it'll give you 8 hours of screen on time which is good in my opinion because at the end of the day you'll charge the phone eventually but i don't know how much SOT will be if you play the game because I've never tested that so if you're not a gamer then battery won't disappoint you.SCREEN : screen is average because some other brands at 20k produces better colours (realme, moto and redmi) refresh rate is good but multi media experience isn't the best but it's not even bad like it's not really disappointing but i would say i don't mind with this segment and brightness is really good. No problem for using in direct sunlight.UI : most disappointing feature for me personally is UI because I've switched to funtouch from realme UI and this fun touch isn't that bad but if you like oxygen, realme and one UI then you'll get disappointed. There are some bugs in the UI but it's minor so it's acceptable but trust me if UI matters for you most anything than camera, battery and screen then don't buy this one but it's not that bad if you want overall package because you'll get used it but because of storage and 120hz multi tasking is fast. There's no lag. There are just some minor bug which isn't a big problem.Design is nice üëçChanging is fast üëç it'll charge 100% in an hour which is personally not a problem for me.Device won't get heat up much. Device feels light in hand üëçCall quality is good.Speaker is as loud as single speaker of some other brands but output is good üëç better than many 20k phones.So in my opinion if your budget is tight at this range then this is a good option but only if you don't have many problems with the funtouch os because it's not bug which is unacceptable but there are lot of UI features and customisation features which funtouch os is missing from (oxygen, realme and one UI) but they have promised two years updates so i hope they add some more features to make experience better like other brands."
57,Awesome! except camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Every feature is jampacked and nicely knitted over the phone like:1. Display - Top notch be it colors, video enhancement, brightness etc2. Battery and on time display usage- Excellent3. Performance- Best in class with Qualcomm Snapdragon 8704. Gaming- Exceeded the expectations, no overheating, highly adaptive5. Sound- crisp sound with dual stereo speakersHowever, here comes the thing which totally disappointed me in this price range its the camera. The camera is not at all upto the mark, produces a lot of noise while capturing but after captured it processes it to look good but did not catch my attention . Being a premium mid range phone they could have really worked on this aspect too. Camera has some ui features that takes a jibe but quality of pics is really not what i expected to be.Verdict-- if you are a camera lover, pic, selfie addicts this phone is not for you peeps but if you are ok with the camera then it's a must go within this price range. Except Camera its value for money in the quoted price."
58,"Not just Supar Fast, Its Flash Charges",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this phone continuously for 3 days, And below are the Some Pros and Cons which i observed.Pros :Battery : I just want to speak first of all about battery. Its gives me around 7:30 to 8:00 Screen on timing means if you charge your mobile in morning then it will last long till night For normal use.If you use your phone continuously like watching videos, playing games, social media, etc then it still gives you 10 to 12 hours of battery backup. I want also like to inform you about its charging, its just charged with 45 minutes from 0 to 100.Display : You have already read in specification that it Providing amazing display with Good refresh rate. So you will have amazing experience while watching movies, videos, Playing games etcGaming and Processor : I have Play Around 3 hours continuously bgmi phone never get lag, heat or any issue i found, its play smooth as like you are playing in ios devices. Gamer can go for this Phone without any doubt. This mobile having Super stable snapdragon process so if you are maltitasking or switching from apps.etc you will never face any lag/hang issue from thisCamera : If someone thinking that this is only gaming phone so you are wrong, this is all in one with good price range, Camera will also not disappoint you both front and back. Good stability while recording videos and many other features are also there but i never used that like panaroma, potrait,etc .Build and look : Phone looks primium both the colours (I have purchased dark Nova colour). Slim phone, light weight matt finish.Other features: Phone carries so much features because its comes under funtouch OS while gives you goof customize option as per your choice, Fingerprint sensor is also good, i have never face any issue on itCons :Cons is not affect me that muvh because i have alternative options available with me.Headphone jack : Phone does not have headphone jack but they will provide adaptor so it not will make any issueExternal expandable option : 128 GB verient i have purchased but if they can give some other expandable options so then it can he a great phone because if we are paying 30k then they should give expandable option also but 128 gb is enough for me as per my use but may not be enough for someone other so thats way i am giving it 4 StarsThankyou üëçüèªüëçüèª"

64,Decent Camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am writing this review after using for more than 1.5 months...I exchanged my Realme XT and went for thisCamera (7/10)The camera is decent. Selfie camera is best in segment, but the rear camera is okay.Low light is amazing and very bright and detailed....The biggest issue is that the details are very less and the colours.. when ever there is a reddish coloured object, the phone oversaturates and makes the red look pink...If you want best camera go for Oppo Reno 8 or A52s 5g.Display (9/10)Very bright and good display . I used it at 120hz..Speakers (6/10)Quality of speakers are good, but loudness is low and bass is non existent.Trust me my Realme XT had louder speakers.Performance (10/10)Very smooth and snappy. BGMI and Apex legends runs very smoothly.Battery (4/10)bb is crap shit.....even in normal use without gaming I only get maximum 5-6 hours SOT....with gaming only 4 hours.Charging is fast.It takes 35min for charging...Software (4/10)It's good and fast....but not at all smooth... YouTube is stuck at 60hz and Twitter lags at 120hz...MIUI and Realme UI is smoother.Updates are very fast, I got 2 updates in one month.Other featuresHaptic feedback is bad and weak...Realme and Xiaomi gives better.IR blaster is useful.Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate.Overall if you want all round package then this is good choice...If camera is your priority go for Oppo Reno 8 or A52s 5g...If gaming is your priority this is good choice.If you are normal user then I won't recomend this phone, go for Nothing phone."

Flagship gaming mobile ultra smooth.7.provide all the sensors even Ir sensor providedCons1.Not a camera centric smartphone.2.No NFC sharing .3.Iqoo has their own dedicated system utility application but only flaw is a file manager and pdf viewer it comes  with Google file manager."
72,Just Okay!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Hard-core Gamer and been using it for 2 weeks for now and can give a full proper review.1. Battery: isn't upto mark, I played Apex Legends (80+ hours on this device) and in a hour it drops around 20% in balanced mode and 25% in monster mode so which sums up that in balanced you can play 4.5 hrs and in monster 3.5 hours which is a bit disappointing but manageable.2. Charging: Upto the expectations charges 50% in 16-18 mins and It takes me around 38 mins for full.3. Gaming with recording: I played 2.5 hours and it dropped 46%.4. Heating: I don't know what this cascade cooling system but works very well. My device reached around 42¬∞( according to phn but felt it was much higher) but there wasn't a single frame drop.5. Unexpected: Yesterday there was a huge battery drop in 2.5 hours of gaming it dropped 76% where in 2 weeks of testing it has dropped only dropped around 50% for same duration.( Will update about it later)6. Overall: it's good for a gaming device and I would recommend it.Others aspects of the phone:Camera: hugely disappointed blur while zooming the clicked pictures.Amoled Screen: Just Wowüò≤ I'm experiencing the colours I have never seen before saw three different movies with different colour tones.A. Batman looked sharp as glass in dark themesB. Doctor Strange looked beautiful and you can see every colour perfectly.C. RRR looked good too with the moderate colours the cinematography has.Battery: In normal usage it's okay can last a day but for 4.7k mah it should go bit longer and I'm not even using 120hz.Bloatwares: disappointing and irritating with unknown notifications.Speakers: Okay!!My last words are please works on the little areas which I mentioned and it doesn't live upto 30k phn segment mainly because bloatwares but overall Okaish."
73,Very good looking phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In camera department phone is awesome, especially in night photoshoot. Screen is bright. I didn't know that I would expect IR blaster from iQOO. Totally loved it!"
74,Not as expected,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone. But slight heating issue is there. Sound and battery life are  less compared to my Iqoo3. Purchased this phone for replacing my iq3 but now confused due to the above issues. Iq 3 is perfect except the over wieght issue.
75,"IQOO NEO 6, LOVING IT",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first IQOO phone is NEO 6, it is been 2 weeks and i have no regrets so far. I was using One Plus Nord and exchanged it to bought this one ( when I told my friend I exchanged my One Plus Nord phone for this, he said karboosh bechke neemboo kareedh liya kya..üòÄ).. though i laughed at the joke but I have no regrets buying this one...only few things could be better are likeUI could have been more user friendlyCamera quality is good but not bestBattery is superb, full charge in 35 to 40 mins..Look of the phone is amazing.No heating issues observedOverall nice phone at this budgetAm not a game person though it is mentioned that this is gaming phone"
76,"Battery is good, no heating. Great phone in this budget",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just want to share if in case you are replacing your old phone and if delivery guy refuses to accept and asks to pay for it instead. simply, refuse to take the order and cancel it. in my case he refused initially then got agreed when I refused and said will cancel the order. May be he was trying to cheat me or not sure what was the exact issue.Lets talk about the phone.Battery is awesome. no heating issue and with 80w charger within 30-35 minutes your phone will be full charged.Camera is good but not great. But in this budget, its quite a good deal.Snapdragon 870 processor, you can simply trust the processor and go for it. specially in this budget.Look is awesome but plastic body of it will not give you premium experience like other costlier flagship phone.After purchasing I got to know that it is only offering 4 bands for 5G so you not fully future proof as IQOO 9 se itself is better than this.Overall, 4 out of 5 to this phone in this budget."

79,Impressive Iqoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially I hesitated to buy, bcoz of the brand. Bt Iqoo proved my opinion was wrong.Pros:1. Display - Display is too good and touch response is amazing. It's good for viewing movies & playing games.Rating - 5/52. Main Camera - The main camera 64mp performance is quite immersive. It's taking decent pic in low light and great pic in daylight. Video quality and stabilization is too good.Rating - 4/53. Performance - The power efficient & powerful snapdragon 870 performs well, which makes the best for gaming exp.Rating 5/54. Battery life - 4700Mah, Trust me battery performance is awesome. Solidly you will get a single day for a moderate usage. In 120hz, I got around 6.5 -7 hrs & in 60hz around 7 - 7.5hrs in a moderate usage. (I used to play pubg for 2 hrs a day). Phone is getting fully charged within 40 mins. Thanks to the 80watt charger.Rating - 4.5/5Cons1. Camera - Ultrawide cam is not good.Rating - 3/52. OS - Funtouch OS looks average. (Example : If you press the lock button, the phone is getting locked, bt if you press the unlock button within 10secs, it's getting unlocked without asking for fingerprint or pattern) Bugs needs to be fixedRating - 3.5/5Go for it. You will not get disappointed. Best budget flagship phone."
80,Battery performance is very low,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes ,this device getting full charge with 20 min but battery down also in 1 hour without usuage ."
81,An all rounder device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Detailed review after using for 1 month--Brief background: Phones I had considered before buying the neo 6: Iqoo 9 SE, Moto edge 30, Poco F4, Oneplus 9RT, Realme GT2.1. Build quality: Despite the back being plastic.. it's built is pretty good. The back panel feels premium and after applying the clear case (included in box) noone will be able to tell if it's plastic back or glass back unless they remove the case and feel it for themselves. Frame is also plastic and imo it will get small amount of scratches over a period of time. Rating 8/10.2. Design: It's everyone's personal preference. For me, I like it's design and would probalby give a high rating of 8/10 for it's looks.3. In hand feel: It's weight distribution is pretty good and it feels solid in hand. Nothing to complain about here. Rating 9/10.4. Display: The E4 amoled used is easily amongst the best at this price range. The colors are very good..blacks are deep and no tint issue either. Supports HDR 10+ . Further, the bezels and chin are pretty thin and you won't notice them after applying the case. Though there are phones that offer even thinner bezels like moto edge 30 and even poco F4 but this slight difference won't matter unless you put them side by side. For its price I would rate it 9/10 here.5. Speakers: Pretty good. Though slightly treble centric and less bassy, the clarity and loudness is pretty good. Rating 8/10.6. Performance: SD 870 along with iqoo's optimization and 120hz RR makes this one of the best performance phones upto 30k. You won't find any lag or jittering in any day to day task. It's fluid in everything. Rating 10/10.7. Gaming: Only played bgmi(pubg) and I have been impressed by it's endurance. I have played for 4 continuous hours and it doesn't get heated. Further, it doesn't throttle the performance even after 4 hours. It provides constant 60 fps in majority of scenarios barring a few like bootcamp hot drop where it might drop a few frames but even then nothing comes close to its performance upto 30k. (though the poco F4 is almost as good). Rating 9/10.8. Cameras: Now comes the real test as cameras are very important to me.Selfie: The best selfie phone till 30k. Skin tones, details, color science everything is on point. Rating 10/10.Back camera: The main 64MP sensor clicks beautiful images. The colors are slightly boosted but in a way that makes it look more pleasing(vivo's algorithm). The night mode is really functional and captures a lot of light in dark scenarios. Rating: 9/10.Ultrawide: It's not bad but also not impressive. Though the color science and image quality is pretty decent but owing to the 8MP sensor, the details are sometimes missing. They should have given the 13MP sensor of the 9SE. Rating 6/10.Macro: Useless.Videography: Pretty good again. Rating 9/109. Battery: Amongst the best in this price range. Under normal usage, it will easily last 1.5 days. On heavy usage, it will still last a day.Add to it the 80W fast charging that charges it fully in 33 minutes from 9% to 100% when i measured. No complaints here either. Rating 10/10.10. Software: Funtouch OS has improved a lot lately and it has become pretty decent. Though there are some bugs and glitches which sometimes ruin the experience and other OS like color and realme are better, it's manageable imo and not that bad either. It offers a lot of customisation features and majority of the bloatware can be uninstalled. Rating 7/10.Conclusion: IMO, it's the best value for money phone that you can buy right now.It literally doesn't have any major con. Though the Poco F4 comes close but trusting Poco after seeing their past 2 year track record is difficult.One important argument:Some people complain about it's plastic back which to some extent is justified at this price point. Glass looks more premium and will not get scratches over time. However, they should note that:1. Plastic helps in better heat dissipation, hence better thermals.2. There's no risk of it getting breaked if the phone accidentally falls( glass back can break even if its GG5)3. The plastic used is not cheap. In fact you won't be able to tell it's plastic unless you hold it in hand and feel it. Further, I think the back panel will get very less scratches seeing it's quality. Only the frame is more susceptible to scratches.4. 99% of people use the phone with a case. So plastic or glass back should be the last point of debate while buying a phone imo.Will add to this in case I have missed any point."

83,Colour Shifting issue in display,3.0 out of 5 stars,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Firstly when I received the device the main thing i care is the display and when I tilt the display it shows cooler tone and when I look head it shows warmer colour I don't know it has issue with anyone else or not but I rate the display 3/5. Overall the device is good. Gaming performance is good yes I noticed some little lags in Asphalt 9 on max graphics but it is acceptable every high end phone little bit lag. But in BGMI and COD i didn't notice any major lag yes the lags come when there is nearby enemies but it is also acceptable so no issue in performance it's good. Battery life is decent I got 5hrs sot, Speakers quality is also decent didn't except too much. Atlast camera is good specially in low light it didn't disappoint. So if I sumup my conclusion it's more a performance centric device so if you looking for performance beast then go for it."

86,Don't buy this,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lot's of bugs in this mobile ...app encryption not works properly.this is very basic feature. Contact number display option not available. I am not refer this IQOO brand.  After I was used two weeks i written this review...call also disconnected after 5 mints
87,Not recommanded,1.0 out of 5 stars,Phone is loosing network and camera is not upto the mark at this price
88,Not for gaming,1.0 out of 5 stars,"In earlier mobiles iqoo provided background calls feature while playing the games. In this mobile neo 6 they haven't provided that feature. When someone is calling you while playing the game, it will come out of your game. So you will miss your game flow. I bought iqoo mobile for this important background calls feature. Worst experience."
89,"A good buy below 28,000.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great value for money product.It has most of what it takes to be a budget flagship killer.A good processor,big battery,nice display and very good cameras.The UI and software experience can be improved though.It charges in forty minutes and lasts more than a day.It‚Äôs a little too big for small hands but overall it ticks all the boxes in terms of performance,dispay, battery life etc.It Will satisfy most users.One can go ahead and buy.My experience was positive."

91,The Flagship Killer in this price segment,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am using this phone for the last two days. The detail information is given below .1) Processor :- It's a stable processor. It's good for multitasking and gaming. At a time you can use 5 to 10 different apps . Nothing , I said , nothing will happen to the phone .2) Charging :- The 80 watt flash charger takes only just 35 min to complete 0 to üíØ % .3) Camera :- Before buying this phone I saw the review of this phone . After seeing those videos I thought that it has just decent camera . But now I can realise it's not decent , it's up to the mark . Specially the front camera and editing features are too good .4) Screen :- The 120 Hz Super Amoled display is in decent performance . Touch sensitivity is too good .5) OS :- It has Funtouch OS. Some extra apps , bloatware are in the phone , but you can uninstall those.6) Battery :- Here I will give 4 out of 5 . The battery drainage is little bit fast . For medium to high users it's tough to make 24 hours with out charging . But at the time of charging you would be spell-bounded. Just put on the phone in charging and make a slow walk in the corridor , it would be 10 to 50 % ü•∞ .7) Finger print sensor :- The sensor is also little bit slow. You have to put the finger seriously on the sensor not in a casual mood.After all it's a beast for me ..Over all I can give 4.5 out of 5 .. You can rely üíØ % to this phone ."

94,High Quality Affordable Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was searching to replace my phone after five years. After almost two months of research I couldn't find one as the good quality phones were above 40k range or the ones which were in the range of 20k didn't have what I wanted.My work requires mobile full day for email, whatsapp, phone so I was looking for a good battery phone which can also charge instantly. I am an amateur photographer so I was looking for good quality camera phone as I cannot carry my DSLR all the time.Then finally last week my son recommended iQOO 6 Neo due to its specification, camera quality and instant charging (80W charger). I had not heard the name so was not able to make up my mind then I realized its Vivo phone and due to my previous good experience with Vivo (phone lasted for 5 yrs and is still in good condition), I decided to go for it.I have been using it for past 4-5 days and loving the experience. Battery backup is amazing charges in 40 mins and lasts till next day (more than 30 hrs), camera quality is quite impressive but could have been better. I feel proud to carry this gadget. A quality phone at an affordable price. If you are looking for a phone in the range of 30k then no second thought."

96,Amazing experience in day to day life,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used it for 3 weeks now.No natural lags. Memory management seems fine. It does not kill apps like Spotify but will kill Outlook which is fine by all means as it shows that Outlook is a battery drainer.I have not used it for gaming even though its game centric. But I am very much in love with the 120 Hz display, really bright. I love that the OS has kept a good amount of stock android features in line.My most used apps are Instagram, Twitter, Firefox Focus, Pocket, Spotify, WhatsApp. I can also say that the front camera video output in Duo video calls looks really good, even in low light. I am also enjoying the 60fps videos. And I am a very heavy step person, hence OIS has definitely helped there.I am also completely in love with the local wallpapers rotation in the lock screen.Improvement in areas:Widgets can be a bit better in the sense some of them do not have the ability to resize."

100,IQOO Neo 6 has best performance and battery life within the budget.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Genuine review: After using for 3 days, battery backup is superb and performance is mind blowing.There are few things that needs to be added, I hope IQOO will takeover that in the software update.While watching YouTube videos and other OTT app videos, the volume is not like stereo speaker or Dolby Atmos. The bottom speaker has high in volume compared to top speaker. This should be fixed, both should be in equal sound.Fast charging is mind blowing.Display quality is good. We wish IQOO should not disappoint the customer's like OnePlus is doing now a days with the software glitches.Finally our data should need more privacy and secured, no IQOO team has to be access customers data.Thank you üòä"

104,Good Hardware Value for money Bad Software and Bloatware Not a bad Camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Hardware specs with proven 870 - though an year old, discontinued by few other brands; great charging, Nice display, dual stereo speakers, Nice Call and data quality with good signal reception. Acceptable battery performance with aggressive power management. The IR blaster is a good surprise.The phone has come possibly with a preinstalled screen guard. A nice Tempered glass would be a good replacement though. Plugging  in my 3.5mm Headphone with the adapter provided was seamless.Can charge from 20 to 100 in close to 30 mins. Battery easily lasts a day for normal usage. Acceptable levels of heating with continuous usage for an hour.Boot time took a bit unusually longer than expected (may be the bloatware).Debloated most apps using adb shell and pm uninstall for user 0. This does not need oem unlocking or rooting. This is not uninstalling the bloatware, but completely disabling it for the current user - which works and is sufficient. Was able to remove facebook and its services, amazon, sharechat, mojo, default broswer, easyshare, google pay, China based unipay, tips, cloud, bbk apps, etcThere are two to three apps that you possibly are restricted from disabling.Using a VPN based adblocker like Tracker Control showed data hitting India and US.Camera - The main one is a decent one, the app is also decent with pro, sport, slow mo, dual facing options.Would have loved a stock android experience on this hardware spec. Anyone spending close to 25K + on a phone should not be treated with unwanted bloatware.Updates:After a week, heating issues, Android auto flickers, doesn't work.Updates:Recent update has fixed few issues. Heating issues improved. Android auto works."

However the product I received has 3 major issues/detects. Abnormal heating while using certain apps like camera, frequent call drop & voice issue for almost every call and fast draining of battery. I tried to troubleshoot shoot the device with help of IQOO customer care, but still nothing is working. Now waiting for Amazon to either replace or refund. Let's see!  Guys please don't invest in this device yet because of many similar complaints about the device. Once IQOO comes out with some solutions to these major problems you can think to purchase this phone. Till then please please avoid this phone."

110,Best of best. Champion phone the segment,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a flagship killer smartphone in 30k segment.

On calls for about 45mins a day + use hotspot for about 30 mins a day. No social media usage. Only WhatsApp installed that too only for messaging. Keep 4g on for close to 16 hrs a day.Battery : With usage mentioned above the battery goes from 100% to 55% in about 9 hrs. I'll rate it as poor.Keypad : there's an issue which I've not be able to zero on but a lot of time while hitting space bar or pressing back key the app on which I'm typing minimises. Not sure if it's a glitch on the software or it's due the way in which I type. Will update.

123,Would not say as terrific as specified by youtubers and most of people.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched from Redmi note 7 pro 6/128 in which I used to use Corvus ROM, so coming to iqoo neo 6 1.) It's display is mind blowing comparing to my rn7pro I love it's display, colors feel true and screen is clearly visible at 50% brightness level so 10/10 for display.2.) Fingerprint and face unlock are fast and reliable.3.) Gaming experience compared to rn7pro it's beast. I didn't felt any lag or jitter in bgmi, apex, genshin. Minor heating was there but not as much as compared to my old rn7pro.4.) Lookwise I personally don't like it's polycarbonate back rest everythings good.5.) Now comes camera, I would say it's ok ok, pics clicked are not out of the blue. I personally loved the gcam of my rn7pro. I would say in terms of camera the outcome is not upto mark, camera performance is same as mobiles below 20k.6.) Now comes durability phone is durable, and as people are saying their would be not scratches and all I just wanna tell you don't fall for that your back pannel will be full of scratches in long run though chances of getting scratches on screen are quite low.7.) Now comes main part where I felt this phone really made me think I shouldn't have bought it in first place and that's it's battery. It charges quickly but it also discharges quickly. I would say my 4 year old rn7pro has better battery backup than this mobile.8.) Ui I don't feel upto mark since I am habitual to stock android so these skins doesn't please me much, just waiting for it's warranty to end and XDA developers to release roms for this phone.9.) I would say people who want to start their career in gaming or want to live stream go for it. But keep in mind it doesn't give good battery backup so if you are streaming bgmi then you'd have to end stream in 2-3 hrs.10.) One more problem that I faced is, splitter provided is not of good quality and I don't know why but has some problem with Sony earphones and headphones. Sometimes their is crackling noise, sometimes mic doesn't work you have to role the splitter maybe problem with my unit but i experienced it. All over for my 4 day usage I'd say mobile is cool and good, i didn't feel any major heating issues like I used to face in rn7pro. On scale of 10 I'd rate this phone 7. Let's hope iqoo doesn't play games like mi and degrade this phone via updates like Mi does.Update-It lags in bgmi when battery goes below 40% even in classics."

But there is the sacrifice of data consumption messages, but I think this is not much concerned as the flash messages! If it worked let others know!=========Purchased this phone @17k after having bank discount and exchanging my 3.5 year old OnePlus 6.Phone is really good. I use it for general purpose like fb, WhatsApp, kotak, yono and office related apps like intune company portal outlook teams.- No heating that I noticed while using or charging.- Smooth onscreen fingerprint unlock.- installed many apps like practo ola uber. Everything is working fine.Only thing that is bothering me is the flash message. Whenever you get a flash message from your network service provide, it opens in a new window instead of showing on the same screen. Due to this, I am unable to login into my Kotak app as it requires you to be on Kotak app when it tries to log you in via sms validation. Kotak app send message from your phone for validation and we get a flash message showing remaining SMS balance from service provider which changes your screen from kotak app.This seems to be related to the funtouch OS as this wasn't the case in oxygen OS in my OnePlus.Overall good phone and I recommend it."

There are not many fonts to experience although it gives a quite stock android feel (i.e status bar, notification icons, volume levels). And also cases/covers may not be available in the market. Camera photos also don't surprise you at this price (but shocked by the Oneplus 7t photos). Majorly, this 120Hz is a lie, you'll know it when you buy this type of phones. It don't really offer you that refresh rate, but offer you somehow with 90Hz. Talking about the good talks, this offers you the best gaming experience in racing games (like F1, RR3, Assoluto & Truckers of Europe 3). The quality of this display is also good, it offers you 4k experience in YouTube & HDR10+ support in Netflix. Battery is also good & charging speed keeps you up in track. The Auto-brightness support is really really good. Overall it's a good phone and value for money except  the UI."
134,Background notification not received,3.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't not open the teams app. I am not receiving messages until open the app. App notification system is very bad. Only mail notifications coming properly. Remaining app notifications are not coming even it opened in background mode. Worst phone for working IT employees. No app receiv ok ng the notification.
135,Features loaded value for money phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,This IQOO Neo 6 is my first phone from Vivo family. It is loaded with best possible features in this price range. The only observation is that the auto beautification done by front camera and the resulted image is far from reality. The image quality needs improvement.
136,Awesome phone...in 25 to 30 min 0to 100 %,5.0 out of 5 stars,For gaming this phone is best....display is nice....design is also good....overall awesome....no heating issues.....camera is also great...
137,Very happy with the phone's performance.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been using IQOO NEO6 12/256 for almost 20+ days now. Very happy with the product. Charges full in about 30 minutes. The charger though becomes a bit hot but the phone stays cool. The batry lasts for a day comfortablely on a moderate to slightly heavy use. The photos are good. Phone works fine and is fast enough to do your daily things and surfing the net. It has lot of hidden features that it offers. Check on YouTube videos for more information.Got a good exchange on my old phone, bank discount and a 2 year warranty on my phone, which no other phone company was offering at the time of my  purchase. This can only be offered by any company if it is confident about its product. So check on the various offers and buy this phone. It's a good product.Will update my review if I experience any problem with the product.The only flip side that I have noticed after more than a month of use is that it has a very small length of the charging wire. Not even a metre long, just 36 inches that's all. At times that's just not enough. So that is surely a bit of a discomfort. So I had to buy a longer ""fast charging"" wire separately."
138,Perfect Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a colour.. excellent performance.superb phone
139,Not as I expected,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone camera, battery, speed, processor all are fine, but the UI is not good. Even after keeping the notifications on i don't get any notifications for most of the applications. It's irritating, i miss chats and imp notifications like emails and teams. The gesture control is also not perfect, it gets confused between left swipe and back. Even though the phone is good the UI creates too much problem."
140,Poor software built-in and Poor Multimedia experience,1.0 out of 5 stars,Whatever the features might be. Only highlighting the specifications. But there are huge software defects and sound clarity is poor through headphones. And there is No Hi-fi dac or Dolby atmos sound for this processor premium processor.
141,Funtouch OS is not fully Optimised Very Laggy Software Experience,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Funtouch OS is not fully Optimised for Iqoo neo6.

143,Definitely go for it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely worth the money. excellent performance, great cooling, well optimized UI, perfect for gaming.. didn't face any lag issues or anything like that. touch response is top of the line. camera doing a great job with the night mode, but sometimes the pictures are noisy in dark scenarios. Battery charges very quickly with the 80W adapter and also the battery drain is decent. But again all over the phone is greater than any other smartphones in this segment and it's definitely a flagship one.. feels premium in hand. Go for it, you won't be disappointed."
144,Excellent phone in this segement,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good phone...you can buy for those who are not very heavy user this phone is excellent. i owned 12GB configuration and using this from last one month...its result is excellent and performing very smooth. the only thing is camera quality which could be better, call recording getting reveled to next person when to try to record their call.If this is not your concern then go for it without hesitation."

147,The killer smartphone of this range,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMGWhat a killer smartphoneI was confused between nord2T poco F4 and iQOO Neo 6But iQoo Neo 6 is definitely has better cameras than other 2.It has great battery life and charging is superfast.Display is good not great thoughSound is loud but lacks bass.Main thing is thermal management has been done really great.No heating issues.Performance is super fast.I read lot of reviews on YouTube and from my experienceIt's definitely better than poco F4 and Nord 2T
148,"IQOO Neo 6, powerpack performance",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well to all those who are planning to purchase this phone let me tell you 2 things1. If you are a gamer, then I guess this review won't answer most of your queries.2. If you are a generic user like me, who likes to click decent pictures, scroll through social media, use different lifestyle apps like Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa or maybe use this phone for little bit of your professional stint like using Excel, word and mails then this phone is not going to disappoint you.Infact, I am using the 8-128 version of the phone and trust me I dont have any issues with the phone be it the Bluetooth, wifi, cellular network, gps, or say anything that comes to the daily usage of any user. The only thing that ofcourse troubles me and irritates me are those bloatwares, mostly the apps, which you could perhaps uninstall.The major pros of this device areThe camera is a stellar especially with the OIS feature. Dont compare with the iPhone or Google phone's.The battery is a power house. If you are not an intense user it would last for a day since the memory management and battery optimisation is good.The processor is a great at this price point. SD 870 is something you won't expect in a phone at this price point. It doesn't heat at all.I will add some more points after a couple of days of usage.One thing that lags is the no of 5g bands which is 4 but we still have a year of time for 5g to be operational."
149,Great product!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery- I get one full day of battery life with even two hours of BGMI.Camera- I won't take much photos but still happy with the quality.Performance-Best in class and no heating issues.
150,Nice phone in this price range...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Seamlessly fast, refresh rate awesome, camera is pro...tried and compared with Nord 2, front cam should be atleast 32 mp or above but this with added features for video call justifies the price, battery back-up after 3 days usage...of you use it frequently over the net or games it drains, but not that fast.... but again you hv that monster of a 80W flash charger which charges in no time. Will not say worth buying but yes it is a real worth trying...one can feel the premiumness. If all goes well with IQOO then they could compete with Mr. Dimensity."
151,"Good screen, awesome processor, avg battery",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first experience with high refresh and AMOLED display, so my opinion could be biased in that way. My previous phone was 3.5 yrs old. Compared to that this is huge upgrade. Charges very fast, and app open closes very fast thx to sd870.Device does not heat. Only moderatlyCamera has been of very little use for me (certainly not for photography), so i dont have enough knowledge to rate. Still it gets above avg images.Some visible cons: I have heavily used this for games and videos during the start. I feel battery has started to loose charge retention already, which is early for this kind of degradation. I knew about the ill effects of fast charging on battery, maybe that and heavy use is the cause.Will update more!"

164,Read this if you are currently using a high end phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My review of IQOO Neo 6 comes from my bias of using OP7 Pro. The first thing that I noticed right out the box is the display. (3/5)There is a lack of richness in the screen. The blacks are black but the clarity suffers the consequences of its pricing.The next bit is the in-display finger print scanner. (2.5/5)The scanner seems inconsistent at first. But the culprit is its size. Should have been a bigger module. You will find yourself tapping more than once to unlock.The switch from one phone to another is a nervy moment. If you have backed up everything you need, Neo6 let's you switch right back where you left. Again, you will never retain everything, so be prepared. (4/5)The phone comes with a massive chip. Snapdragon 870 is its biggest selling point. And it does not disappoint. BGMI runs like butter on hot phulka. Transitions are smooth. Apps have almost no lag-time. Without SD870 this phone would have lost atleast 25% of its charm. So a well deserving 4/5. I do expect the performance to degrade quicker than other flagship phones. 30k can only get you so much.Call quality and connectivity is just right. (3.8/5)Audio is one aspect that suffers as much as display. The richness is just not there. (3/5)It has only been a day for me with this phone but I know that the camera is not going to get better with updates. It's works fine as long as the pictures are viewed on a smaller screen. You may not be able to get an awesome physical print off this camera. However, others have pointed that it's great for it's price point. (4/5)Design-wise it's 5/5. I have the cyber rage one and it's beautiful. The camera module is big for many but I would rather have a working module than something that trades off functionality over aesthetics. The phone feels big because of its thin bezels but so far they have not distracted me one bit. The front facing camera is a constant nibble on my eyes.Charging takes around 30 mins to complete which is a great thing. Again, I do see this changing with time.One thing that feels right is the OS. It's almost layered underneath everything else. Not drawing attention at all. And that is a great sign. (4.5/5) Just ignore the third party apps which comes with the phone.Last but possibly one of the most important element is it's box contents. A transparent case, USB c charger, pin and a c-type to 3.5mm convertor. It costs next to nothing but provides so much delight to a user. (4.8/5) the charger wire could be longer.Verdict: Go for it if you are tied under 30k. The brand seems like they understand the segment. The product might feel cheaper in hand compared to other phones with similar specs but the tradeoff is worthy. Broken glass backs are better than hard plastic cases.Reasons to chose another phone over IQOO Neo 61. A phone that delivers a supreme camera module.2. Better display quality3. Gorilla glass. But I have shattered them before so maybe this is not as much of an issue.Hope you have your answers."
165,Power-packed performance!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered it after seeing so many videos of so many gadget testers. But after ordering it I saw some really poor ratings here so I was a bit tensed. But all that is in the past now! I've been using this phone over a week now. And my genuine review about this phone is that it's awesome for Gaming! 870G is one of the best processor indeed. I've been playing too much in this phone as I'm a gamer. And it doesn't disappoint me. I play BGMI for hours in this phone and the gameplay goes really smooth and it's doesn't have a heating issue and the battery backup is pretty decent. And it takes me about 30 minutes max to fully charge my phone. The cameras are also pretty decent. My whole family is basically fond of Samsung and it's my first time going off that track to buy this and I'm not disappointed at all! If you really wanna have a powerful gaming phone this look no more and buy it!Thank you to those who actually finished reading the whole comment.
166,Lots of user complaints about battery issues,3.0 out of 5 stars,The stated capacity of the battery is 4700 mAh but it is not even anywhere close to half of that apparently. I installed AccuBattery app right after setting up the device and it shows estimated battery capacity at 2238 mAh. Since the data has a very small sample size I'll keep rechecking it after a few days but even in real world usage I feel that the battery isn't close to 4000 mAh. In fact I got a better battery backup in my 2 year old realme X that had a 3700 mAh battery. I would highly recommend everyone to use AccuBattery or any such app to get a good idea about the battery capacity!

169,Dissapointed with Amazon and Battery life and Processor of Iqoo neo6,2.0 out of 5 stars,"1. Battery backup is not that good. Just even for normal youtube video view the battery is not coming for one full day, Leave about gaming.2. I really doubt about the processor is Snapdragon 870 or very much less configuration.Many apps are taking so much time to open and to respond.3. Many times i had issue with fast pairing of realme ear buds. And one more issue i have faced with Amazon is they have a bad return policy of exchange mobiles. The very next day of submission of our old phone, at any cost you will not get it back by any chance if you want it back. They are not mentioning about this that clearly. Becarefull about this guys."

172,Not as expected,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ram management is very poor ..even if it has 870 processor and 8+4 gb ram...most of the apps doesn't remain on same page ..it refresh the page from start...it's not expected for 870 processor...need to improve in software update.. hope it wil improve but till now it's not good ...I am spending 27k for this phone and apps are refreshing... It's really annoying...iqoo shud improve the UI for their phones....even colour reproduction is not good... 120hz refresh rate doesn't work like fast ... It feels very slow in monster mode as well... Even my last Samsung phone worth 15k performing better than this ... And this is 30k phone ...
173,Overhyped product from IQOO.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overall experience is good but improvements are required in camera department I had exchanged my realme XT for for iqoo neo6 which has the same 64 mp samsung sensor but I had to say images on my realme XT was more more optimised than on neo6.
174,black screen bleed and other display issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen has an issue when we use phone in landscape mode, you can see red line at the bottom of the corner. look at the photo I have posted. Due to this issue, I have replaced the item and in the replaced unit as well, I have seen the same issue. It seems like this issue is with all neo 6 phones.There is also one problem of color bleeding when you use phone in a dark room and you have black color on screen, you will clearly see grey spots on half the screen. I couldn't click photo with this issue because in light, this issue is not visible.finally I returned the item and looking of a better one."
175,Camera is not good,2.0 out of 5 stars,Front cam is not up to the price point. There are grains in the image when I take selfie. Camera quality doesn't match with the YouTube reviews not even near. compromise with the plastic back. I bought 8 gb version I saw lag in playstore and YouTube. Why they call it a flagship it is a midrange phone with a flagship price. Charging is the only thing good in this.
176,Basic things doesn't work properly,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm writting this review after using the phone for couple of weeks.Pros:Battery life and flash charging.Cons:Basic bugs, after charging, we can't swipe to the Google discovery.Volume is very low with the headset, we need to increase to full volume to listen, whereas with speakers the volume is much better.Camera quality is not good when compare with oneplus Nord 2. OnePlus Nord 2 giving better real pictures than this.May be good for gaming but not for listening music and for normal users."
177,Delivery,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is best in the phone and everything is perfect with the order just the problem was the delivery time. It was 14 days long and the interesting thing is that from where the order was shipped was it was just a hour distance from me. It took 13 days to ship. This was the only flaw for me. Really disappointed with the delivery.

181,Smooth Performing device with a few quirks,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this device for 20k with exchange offers & coupon... Been using this for 10 days now and I must say that I love it... I have an apple üçé iPad Air too ... So as I use both the IOS & Android simoltaneously I must say I haven't encountered any bigger issue yet... It's all smooth in the field of performance... Haptics really amazing...But there are some issues regarding app optimisation... Apps like Facebook & You tube don't run at 120 HzRegarding the bloatware & ads issue u can turn them off totally... And it's much close to stalk Android then Realmi UI or MiUi..Coming to camera section - The main rear camera performs really well with good dynamic range and close to natural color than previous Vivo phones ( still sometimes it saturates the pictures a bit)Video stabilization works really great ...The ultra wide & macro sensors are totally useless...The selfie camera works wonders though... With great exposure control & color balance ...Battery - The charging is really fast... It takes abt 40 mins to reach 0 to 100But the discharging rate is a bit fast too... U might encounter battery self drainage a little bit... Even then it would be sufficient to last for one whole day with 6 hrs screen on time for mixed users ...In the end I ud like conclude by saying that if u r getting this for 26k around then it's a great deal ...**Update :- This device has issues with read and write speeds . When I'm trying to copy a file from pen drive via OTG the copying speeds drop from 100 Mbps to nearly 10 Mbps , even it stops copying sometimes. This is an serious issue as it has got no support for sd card ."

¬†Everyone think this smartphone as a performance centrik phone and yeah I am not denying because many 870 phones don't give highest performance of 870 but this device do best.... I was confused between poco f4 and iqoo neo 6 First I ordered poco but then my mind got changed and I ordered iqoo and I was right..... This phone is not only performance centered phone but also it is camera centered phone too.... Iqoo neo 6 camera is just awesom if you want natural pics then this phone has the capacity to give you full camera performance... Also I clicked many pics in night without any street light or anything just moon light and it gives awesome pics trust me I ordered iqoo neo 6 and spent 6k more than poco f4 (24k) only for some main reason1. Beast performance best 870 phones with 7.3 lakh plus antutu score2. Best camera in this price segment from gaming phones.3. In display fingerprint4. Customizationsnare awesome.....5. I'm hand feeling is so premium.... Not heavy not bulky6. Display is also impressiveEdit after 15 daysI uploaded some pics which was clicked in absolutely dark night.... And I was shocked how it could capture those pics which I couldn't see properly..... Superb cameraTRUE FLAGSHIP KILLER"

Infact good colours and night mode is very impressive.Charging is very fast and screen on time is very good in compare to other brands.There are some bloatwares in the fone but u can uninstall them permanently by so many methods available on YouTube.Processor is good , no heating issue, and so many customisation options are available, but in term of OS the oxygen OS is still remains on top, but funtouch OS is now very optimised and need some more optimisation with improved user interface.Overall phone is great value in this range.Go for it."

¬†got it today‚Ä¶.  Smooth experience, camera is awesome in both front and back‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs design and look is fascinating..finger print sensor is too good‚Ä¶ instead of going oneplus, I would suggest this phone iqoo neo 6‚Ä¶though iqoo is sub brand of one plus,Vivo.

Blindly u can bought it.. two variants one with 30k and 34k but with offer of 3k it‚Äôs 27k and 31k respectively.. if u buy with with exchange of another phone, u can buy this with less price than this.."
200,Iqoo 6 Neo first week review,4.0 out of 5 stars,The device is okBut not big device as expected.Camera is not average performanceAlso not guarantee about OS updates and it's timings sOnly one update after purchasing
201,Please don't buy this phone,3.0 out of 5 stars,Will first excited for feature that have but when come to reality it wasn't worthy because I got defected product first and i ask customer service to replacement. I got another phone that is loading phone when I unlock my phone it shows loading then after I will apper to see the home page. So again I call to customers care they rejected return first and ask proof for that later. I take screen shot and upload in return page then I got approved to return and they ready to pay full amount and after the return they will not send amount what they promised . And started lies those are not refunded. And they send exchange amount in pay balance . I am sorry not provided picture of loading I didn't do backup
202,This is the most perfect phone ü§©,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was really sceptical about buying iqoo but since all the phones was no where in comparison to Neo 6 so I ordered it. The phone is really good.. I'm not a gamer..I'm a photograph enthusiast and this phone has surprised me for all the good reason. The camera is just fantastic. Far better than nord2. Display is top notch. The phone looks and feel premium. You can go for it blindly.
203,Perfectly Splendid,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently purchased IQOO Neo 6 5G . Received in well packaging and contains essential items like back cover, audio jack converter too.The phone really support Fast ‚è© Charging and battery life is also commendable .However I have some more expectations with the camera quality considering the price range .Overally it's a good buy if you want a power pack performer ."
204,Beast performar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this phone almost a week now still no issues found.Pros:-SD 870 is undoubtedly one of the best processor where it comes under heavy workload, video photo editing, multitasking everything runs perfectly smooth and fast.Sound quality is very good and the display is also very bright and able to provide perfect colour.. so multimedia consumption is a great experience.Now coming to battery life... It last one day easily with some casual gaming, multimedia and other day to day task... Also the charging speed is awesome.. you can put it on charge and go for your lunch in the mean time it will be fully charged.. So no issues with battery life and charging..Now the most important thing is thermal management... I have been gaming a lot with this phone but no heating issues even with ultra HD graphics and screen recording on.. but after one hour it gets a bit heated but all under 42-43 degree.. even the performance never dropped not a single stutter or lag.. I personally didn't like the funtouch is but the software is perfectly stable and optimised and there is so many customisation.. I think I am starting to like it better than current oxygen OS..Now the final part is camera.. I thought the camera will not be good specially when it is a performance oriented phone phone but here I was wrong again.. picture quality is very good even in indoor or low light although the colours are a bit over saturated but I think most people are going to like it.. selfie and portrait is also very good with nice details.. In video department the OIS is not as good as advertised although it captures good video but I think it can be improved by providing some update...Final verdict.. If you are looking for a perfect performance phone with great battery life and good cameras then go for it.. It's undoubtedly the best phone under 30k segment.."

Back case provided in the box also not a quality one.Some simple software features are missing: like scan doc, data switch between sims in status bar, there is no step tracking, Google Calling App should improve"
222,Best performance oriented phone under 25k.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this device at 17k after applying all the offers and exchange. So in this price point I would say this is the best that you can ever have.1. Performance is good(Snapdragon 870 is quite stable compared to other 8 series processor.)2. Camera is good enough (Camera was not my priority so it's fine for me.)3. Battery life could have been better,but still it's good enough.4. Charging speed is not exactly same with what the company was claiming, but still its fast enough.5. UI is not that great as it requires so many optimization, but in normal day to day usage it fine.Overall I would say if your budget is around 25k then you can definitely consider this device."

Pictures are over exposed and full of noise.Also found the sound volume is becoming low at times.I was trying to return, which is not possible. Also amazon is not replacing the item siting that this is a quality issue and they can't address quality issue.So next time I would prefer to buy a phone from an offline store."

I compared that all mobiles with this IQoo new 6. And really it's unbeatable.While buying I was thinking how I can trust this new company, never I seen it on any hand. But trust I bought it and now I love it.It's camera quality is superb in this range of smartphone. Battery backup is very good, Fully chargable in 35-40 minutes. It's design looks cool. Fingerprint senser, face unlock is reliable and fast.I think, It could be more thin and lightweight with a glass back.But overall it's a very good smartphone you should buy it."

233,Not up to the mark!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Student and just use this phone as a student. Battery life is just worse. It will give you backup as same as 3500 mAH batteries. It drains for 7-10% in an hour for normal usage and in night during standby it drains 5% in 6 hrs. You have to charge it twice a day for sure. UI is slow. Camera is descent, not bad and also not too good. Phone's call speaker is not good. Sometimes it breaks the sound. I will rate 3/5 for its Proximity Sensor. The thing that this phone has something good is its Speaker, its display, its design and nothing else. You Should look for S20 FE / Pixel 6a in this segments (now in sales they are available at around 30-32k), they are far more better options than this with excellent IP ratings."

No Gorilla glass2. Can't use dual apps or app clone , it's working only for 3-4 social media apps. This is really bad. I wanted to use few UPI apps for dual sims but I can't and didn't know it earlier.3. Back side plastic body and not as good looking as glass body.3. Unwanted apps and asking for unnecessary permission. No options  to delete.4. Can't use SD card.Please note that I had bought thismohine after great deliberations and research and after watching videos and reviews on youtube by so called tech specialist.Well, certainly it was a paid promotion and hardly u ll get a honest review.All in all a good phone but could have been better, I would like to own the Xiaomi 10 T better then this one .Goodluck."
1747,Great Package,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so confused b/w this and moto edge 30. But after days of research,i decided to give iqoo a chance. I bought this phone from iqoo store as Bajaj card emi wasn't available on Amazon at the time of purchase(so it won't show as a verified purchase).Things I like* Design is really good* Dispaly - fast, responsive and good  quality* Camera - Never expected the main  camera to be this good. Good details and  night mode is also good. Ultra wide is just  average.Selfie camera is also good.* Battery life & Fast charging - Decent  battery backup but charging is so fast* Good performance - 870 with 8gb is not a  joke. No heating issues also as of now.What I don't like much* Finger print scanner - do not recognise at  times* Speaker - The speaker quality is really  good but I felt that the loudness is bit low* Some bloatwares - Some inbult apps  cannot be uninstalled ( like browser); but  nothing annoyingThe phone case is also very premium looking and comes with a back case, charger, type c cable, 3.5 mm to type c and a sim ejector tool.Overall a great phone with good cameras.  ( except ultra wide) and excellent performance. Totally recommended.üëç"

With 870 snapdragon, the gaming is at different level.The speaker, it's enough to make your whole family awake in early morning. It's that strong and loud with double speakers. Bgmi, bgmi state, Mobile legends, all at ultra HD with full graphics, gameplay are smooth. It's not having heating issues for 2 hours if playing in normal graphics. While on advance full graphics, it got little bit heat after 1 5 hours of time duration, but no effect on gameplay. It become more smoothAnd perfect with extra graphics.  With extra monster mode, the game play is like Butter flow, completely at different level. Just go for it.

Gaming (4/5) (90 fps not enabled, but still, very good, 1 point deducted for missing out headphone jack, it's a must for gaming, using a dongle helps but it's location at the center-bottom of the phone makes my hand hurt while gaming)4. Vibration (unrated) it's there...5. Charging (5/5)6. Design (4.5/5) slightly big for my hand, but the weight management is too good. Phone feels very lightweight7. Software/UI (1/5) this is where i am very very much disappointed, my phone hangs and restarts atleast 8-9 dailyI've removed all the bloat that comes pre-installedBut this restarting problem needs to be fixed ASAPI've experienced this in WhatsApp, Nova Launcher, (small screen shortcut) immediately switching between appsPlease iqoo team, fix this bug.It completely ruins the experience"

And I more complain with batter lift it is not constant . Some time I get abou 8 hours screen on time and some time it drops to 5 hour buty usage are same .
1755,Green tint issue... company is taking no response,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While using the device at night in the dark the green tint is clearly visible and the black areas don't look completely black, it glows and it's very eye catching.

1817,Best to buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewing the product after 20 days of useBattery 8.5/10Camera 10/10Video Feature 10/10I was looking for mobile since March 2022 but no mobile was upto my expectations in context of price against features available. Finally Iqoo Neo 6 met my expectations because I was waiting for its launch. So I can buy it. I am not brand freak but yes where features are good, brand doesn't matter. Seriously when I heard the name of IQOO, I was not aware that it is from house of Vivo Mobiles. I just researched and find it suitable as per features of its mobile phones. The good thing in this mobile is that it is having Snapdragon processor which is found better then other processors. If somebody is looking mobile around 27K with advance specs, he/she should go for it as offers are available."
1818,Absolute beast of a phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using this phone for almost 2 weeks. And here's my review-Camera- 8/10Performance- 10/10Screen- Brightness is excellent.

Phone feels smooth and fast. The in hand feel is also good (use a case though as the camera glass is so wide spread and it could get scratched).
